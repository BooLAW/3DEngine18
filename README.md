# Living Worlds
It's a 3D engine made for degree of Videogames Programming and Design in the subject Engines. Our main goal is to learn how to make a simple 3D engine using third party tools mentioned below.

## Libraries Used


--> [MathGeolib](https://github.com/juj/MathGeoLib): This library is used to calculate simple geometry math

--> [PCG](http://www.pcg-random.org/download.html): Good random number generator

--> [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php): To handle the assertions and help with OpenGL initialization.

--> [mmgr](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge/tree/master/Common_3/ThirdParty/OpenSource/FluidStudios/MemoryManager): Memory Allocation & Leak Detection

--> [STL](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/): containers(vector,array,...)

--> [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui): UI interface. We also used the [docking branch](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/docking).

--> [DevIL](http://openil.sourceforge.net/download.php): For Texture and dds rendering for the models.

--> [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/releases/tag/v4.1.0/): For reading data from the .fbx format

--> [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/documentation/): For the render of 3D models and textures.
